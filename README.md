# Peridot
- A good programming language, with a launcher.
Note that you will need Python 3.10+, and Git [for packages] for this to work.
And also, running the language directly from the src folder might break -- so just use launch.bat instead.

- An example in how to print with Peridot:
```
display "Hello, world!"
```
- There'll be more functions soon - But you might have to wait 1 days since I don't have time currently.
