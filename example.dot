$ this will be your example.
$ the symbol for making comments is the dollar sign, like i am typing right now.

$ i also reccomend you make a new project so you can run code directly from buttons!

$ if you run launch.bat and open this file from the launcher then the console will show up where-ever you put it last time.
$ also, it's optional if you just wanna type "python .peri\\installations\\peri.1.0.py example.dot".

$ printing? try this:
display "hello, world!"
$ this should display hello world. 

$ defining something? try this:

mystring = "hello, world!"
myinteger = 123

$ now you can or embed it to a string:
display "mystring is: ${mystring}"
